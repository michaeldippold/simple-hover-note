# Simple Hover Notes!

This plugin allows you to add hover-to-display notes styled like post-it notes. It does this via a custom TinyMCE button in the WordPress admin that allows you to set a header as well as body content.

## I feel like this could be a lot better

It sure could! Feel free to fork it or submit a PR! 

## This already exists

Maybe! If you like the other one more, use that! I won't be offended.
