# Simple Hover Notes!

This plugin allows you to add hover-to-display notes styled like post-it notes. It does this via a custom TinyMCE button in the WordPress admin that allows you to set a header as well as body content.

![An example of the plugin on the front end](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeldippold/simple-hover-note/master/note-example.PNG)

####To install, simply:
- Download or clone the repo
- Drop the folder into your plugins directory
- Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin.

####Using the plugin:

The plugin adds a button to the WordPress editor that says "Add Note". Select the text with your cursor that you want to add a note to. Click on the "Add Note" button, choose a color, add a title (optional), and add body text. Click "Ok" to view the note. It should display in the editor as well so you can see what it wil look like.

There is no way to directly modify a note. To replace one you will need to delete the text containing the note, add it back, and then recreate the note. I may add a simpler way to do this in the future, if there's interest.

### "I feel like this could be a lot better"

It sure could! Feel free to fork it or submit a PR! 

### "This already exists"
Maybe! If you like the other one more, use that! I won't be offended.
